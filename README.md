I learned a lot through Gitcoin Quest, There are no match of Gitcoin in terms of opportunity for developers.
Web3 is right now, and is the future. As I'm a final year undergrad , i want my future in building web3 and i'm on the way. Gitcoins provide a way to start learning and building on different Blockchain Applications(inderiectly but there are many people who are building on a blockchain right now that they get introduced by gitcoin.) because of the community, the cocepts, the way people are easily finding work that they even didn't know how much they are good at it.
For me Gitcoin has contributed a lot in my learning and developmemnt.
